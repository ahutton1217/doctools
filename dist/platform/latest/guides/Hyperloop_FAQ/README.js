But with the release of Hyperloop, we not only support full, native access to the platform SDK from JavaScript, you can also mix Swift (as well as Objective-C) classes in your apps, allowing you to directly access them from JavaScript.    </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"section section-2 \" id=\"src-51252801_safe-id-SHlwZXJsb29wRkFRLVRpdGFuaXVtd29ya3Nmb3JXaW5kb3dzLkRvZXNIeXBlcmxvb3A_\">\n        <h2 class=\"heading \"><span>Titanium works for Windows.

The main reason for this is because Hyperloop modifies the source files which throws the debugger off track. <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-24037\" target=\"_blank\">TIMOB-24037</a> will hopefully address this issue and is currently slated to be address with the SDK 7.0.0 release (November 2017).    </p>\n    <p>Nonetheless, in iOS, it is possible to debug apps using the Safari Web Inspector which allows debugging Hyperloop because it is directly talking to the active JS context inside the running app. Shockoe has posted a short tutorial called <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"https://shockoe.com/blog/debugging-titanium-applications-using-safari-web-inspector/\" target=\"_blank\">Debugging Titanium Applications using Safari Web Inspector</a>. This approach allows debugging of all Hyperloop code up to where it switches over to the native side. The only downside to this is that there are no source maps available for process Alloy controllers.    </p>\n    <p><a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-24723\" target=\"_blank\">TIMOB-24723</a> (currently slated for SDK 7.0.0 release) addresses the Android equivalent of this issue what allows the utilization of Chrome Dev tools    </p>\n    </div>\n        </div><a id=\"editButton\" href=\"https://wiki.appcelerator.org/pages/editpage.action?pageId=51252801\"><span>Edit</span></a>\n    \n        \n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n","title":"Hyperloop FAQ"});
