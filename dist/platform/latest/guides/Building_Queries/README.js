The functionality may not be functionally complete and there is no commitment for a seamless upgrade to subsequent releases or that the functionality will move to General Availability.

You can create custom queries based on <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Analytics-method-featureEvent\" target=\"_blank\">featureEvents</a> in your Titanium SDK applications using the Query Builder feature. If you have <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Analytics-method-featureEvent\" target=\"_blank\">featureEvents</a> enabled in your application, you can create queries like, &quot;Show me how many times, in the last month, users on Android, tapped the login button&quot;.    </p>\n    <p class=\"txt-14-all pd-top-l\">If you do not have <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Analytics-method-featureEvent\" target=\"_blank\">featureEvents</a> enabled in your application, but do have analytics turned on, you can still use the Query Builder to create queries based on the default fields that are automatically logged (for example, OS, SDK version, and so forth).    </p>\n    <p class=\"txt-14-all pd-top-l\">Some of the capabilities of the Query Builder feature are:    </p>\n<ul class=\" \"><li class=\" \">    <p>Default filters for OS platform, device model, OS version, country, and deployment mode.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \">    <p>Query for specific features or properties set against specific events in the application.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \">    <p>Share the query publicly to all users in the organization.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \">    <p>Build funnels based on the feature events configured in the application.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \">    <p>Setup alert notifications when a query count is below or above a preset threshold.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \">    <p>Compare and visualize multiple queries.    </p>\n</li></ul>    <p>The Query Builder feature is accessible through the Analytics menu on the Dashboard.    </p>\n    <p>    <img src=\"images/download/attachments/51250946/query_builder_02.png\" alt=\"images/download/attachments/51250946/query_builder_02.png\" class=\"confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\">\n        </img></p>\n    <div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-note aui-message warning shadowed information-macro\">\n            <p>For first-time users of the Query Builder feature, a description of the Query Builder feature will be displayed when the<strong class=\" \"> Query Builder</strong> tab is selected.

By default, even when feature events are not set up for an application, it is possible to run queries against default filters such as OS platforms, OS versions, and so forth.    </p>\n    <p>This sample chart displays the results of a query that tracks the count of the application usage on the iOS platform for the last 7 days. The Y-Axis displays the number of times (count) a selected event has occurred satisfying the query conditions. If no events are selected, the chart defaults the Y-axis to the number of times an event has occurred and has been tracked for one or more devices.    </p>\n    <p>    <img src=\"images/download/attachments/51250946/query_builder_04.png\" alt=\"images/download/attachments/51250946/query_builder_04.png\" class=\"confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border\" width=\"500\" height=\"196\">\n        </img></p>\n    <p>Notifications can be configured on saved queries.
