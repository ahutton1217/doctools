Parasitic inheritance takes advantage of the malleable nature of JavaScript objects, allowing a developer to create an instance of a given type, modify it with additional properties, and return it as a new type of object.<br>This is a very powerful technique in JavaScript applications generally, but is even more useful and powerful when dealing with JavaScript proxy objects in Titanium. We can use factory functions in the Ti.UI namespace to create base UI components, and then extend those components with new features and functionality we define ourselves.<br>Find out how use this technique to create a custom ratings widget in this week's episode of Forging Titanium.",

By firing and listening for custom events, we can ensure that components in our system do not need to have knowledge of how other components behave - they just need to know how to indicate to the rest of the application that an important event has happened.<br>Find out how use this technique to create a two-stage utility application in this week's episode of Forging Titanium.",

Throughout our reference guides and official training course, we generally advocate the use of a single JavaScript context in your Titanium applications.<br>However, in our most popular demo application, the Titanium Mobile Kitchen Sink, a tab-based application is developed using multiple contexts by associating each window opened with a URL to a JavaScript file. While this approach is technically valid, it presents the developer with difficulties around sharing data between windows, confusion around when code for a window has been executed, possible object reference issues which can lead to memory leaks, and reloading of JavaScript code in every window for shared libraries. For those reasons, unless you have a specific need for a \"clean slate\" in every window, using multiple JavaScript contexts cannot be considered a best practice approach to structuring a Titanium Mobile application.<br>What then would be a reasonable approach to structuring windows in a tabbed application? And how do we work around the loss of Ti.UI.currentTab and friends? Find out the answer in this week's episode of Forging Titanium.",

				"description": "The Titanium OpenGL Module (Ti.OpenGL) opens the door to sophisticated graphics development for the Titanium programmer by exposing the entire OpenGL ES 1 and ES 2 graphics API to the Ti Javascript environment. The Ti.OpenGL view extends Ti.UI.View with a graphics rendering canvas that is easily managed within the Titanium view hierarchy. In addition, the module provides a databuffer object to hold large datasets and mitigate any inefficiency that arises from modeling datasets in Javascript.<br>This talk demonstrates the pragmatics of building sophisticated graphics displays using Ti.OpenGL in both ES 1 and ES 2. It will reveal several reusable design abstractions that take advantage of features of the Javascript environment. Among the topics to be covered are:<br>- OpenGL basic setup and animation<br>- Use of databuffers for attribute and index arrays<br>- Connecting databuffers and vertex buffer objects (vbo’s)<br>- Using external resources (textures, shaders, etc.)",

				"description": "Mobile applications often need to manipulate data in databases: news, contents, user preferences, etc. Titanium Mobile proposes a complete API, allowing to create databases and manipulate their content, but this module remains low level, as it does not offer the abstraction provided by ORMs (Object Relational Mappers).<br>This session introduces, through concrete examples, the advantages provided by the use of database abstraction tools.<br>It will list the available javascript ORMs on the market, depicting their differences, and will focus on joli.js, the lightweight still complete ORM published by the speaker. The attendees will learn how to take the best out of this ORM, will be taught about its useful querying model, and will learn how to extend it.<br>As a conclusion, a simple web services consumer extension of joli.js will be presented, which allows to consume web services and put their responses in a database through the very same API as joli.js.",
