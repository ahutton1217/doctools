				"description": "One of the best ways to keep a mobile app user engaged is through gamification and a well thought-out reward system. Accomplish certain goals, and you'll be rewarded with anything from points to badges to real world goods. But the real satisfaction is through elevating your social status? be the best amongst your friends!<br />\n<br />\nThis is most certainly true in mobile games. But does it really hold up in the domain of children's games? Perhaps, but not all gamification is created equal when targeting children. The games must be fun, engaging, and keep a child wanting more. But what is the 'more' that you should actually be targeting?"

				"description": "Many people that come to Titanium and Alloy come to it from a background in web development. Having that as a background is great but often times it is lacking in some basic disciplines that are important for success. Success not only in the initial development but also the long term maintenance and upkeep of the app you are building.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen working with frameworks like Titanium or Node.js, it?s easy to have a fire and forget mentality. These frameworks make it so simple to get to ?hello world? that sometimes we forget how important best practices are. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this session I will take you through some of the beginning best practices that have helped me maintain thousands of apps and tens of thousands of lines of code. I have made a lot of mistakes and will try to help you avoid as many of those pitfalls as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis session will be specifically geared for the person that is relatively new to Titanium and/or Alloy and will address things like application structure for Classic and Alloy based applications. The plan is to answer questions like, how and when do I use a window vs. a view? What does it mean to open a window with a different context? How do I use commonJS modules effectively? What is a global event listener and why do people tell me not to use them? How do I get help, and why won?t anyone answer my questions in the support forums?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to love working with Titanium for a long time to come, check out some of the best practices that will help you get there."

Consider the following possibilities:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n• You are designing the official tour guide app for your Secret Island Fortress, painstakingly selecting every color and tint to properly evoke just how secret, how fortified - how intimidating! - your island really is, only to drop in a map colored with pretty blues, and greens and tans. Kind of kills the mood.<br />\n• Or perhaps your Secret Island Fortress is a little too secret, and your current map provider has incorrectly labeled the road to the Welcome Center as the road to the dungeon. Maybe the island isn't on the map at all! <br />\n• Worse yet, when your visitors do arrive, they won't be able to see your map anyway, because the data plans are spotty way out here, and the wifi doesn't reach out to the garden walking path, much less the underground missile silo (when the hatch is closed).<br />\n<br />\nIn this session we will have an overview on:<br />\n• Using the Mapbox TileMill tool to design our map with CSS-based styling that even we non-designers can handle.<br />\n• Importing custom data into TileMill from our own sources or OpenStreetMap using GeoJSON, KML, PostGIS, SQLite, CSV, you name it<br />\n• Bundling it all up in mbtiles format to use in our app with the Mapbox iOS SDK (wrapped in a Titanium module, of course) and host it online or in the app for offline use."

				"description": "Have you ever felt the need to know exactly what's going on during the execution of a Titanium app? What tools or techniques did you use? Adding logging statements to your code for either debugging or profiling purposes can be a last resort solution, but it isn't surely the most flexible. In some scenarios, native development tools can come to help, but they only tell us half of the truth, since they aren?t able to show us what's happening in JS land.<br />\n<br />\nIn this talk I'll present some tools and techniques that allow us to have a clear look at what?s happening under the hood while a Titanium application is running. In particular, we?ll see how to use Chrome DevTools and Ti Inspector (https://github.com/omorandi/TiInspector), as well as additional tools and plugins for debugging, tracing and profiling our applications."

Learn how to get started with these tools and sidestep the complexities of game development so you can get right to the core gameplay elements and mechanics that were previously out of reach for most developers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJohn will be demonstrating game development techniques with Titanium and Platino and will also show how these techniques can make business-related and 'serious' applications more fun and engaging for the end user by incorporating game mechanics into everyday apps."

Parasitic inheritance takes advantage of the malleable nature of JavaScript objects, allowing a developer to create an instance of a given type, modify it with additional properties, and return it as a new type of object.<br>This is a very powerful technique in JavaScript applications generally, but is even more useful and powerful when dealing with JavaScript proxy objects in Titanium.

Throughout our reference guides and official training course, we generally advocate the use of a single JavaScript context in your Titanium applications.<br>However, in our most popular demo application, the Titanium Mobile Kitchen Sink, a tab-based application is developed using multiple contexts by associating each window opened with a URL to a JavaScript file. While this approach is technically valid, it presents the developer with difficulties around sharing data between windows, confusion around when code for a window has been executed, possible object reference issues which can lead to memory leaks, and reloading of JavaScript code in every window for shared libraries. For those reasons, unless you have a specific need for a \"clean slate\" in every window, using multiple JavaScript contexts cannot be considered a best practice approach to structuring a Titanium Mobile application.<br>What then would be a reasonable approach to structuring windows in a tabbed application? And how do we work around the loss of Ti.UI.currentTab and friends? Find out the answer in this week's episode of Forging Titanium.",

I'm also talking about bringing the beauty of web frameworks to Titanium - Stylus, SASS and Less for styling, CoffeeScript and its cousins to enhance development, Jasmine for testing, Backbone for MVC and jQuery and friends to simplify element creation, communication and handling. What if we could use all these techniques on top of Titanium to create native apps even faster and with better structure?<br>The solution is Kranium - the result of merging Titanium with web development techniques, creating a cyborg which is greater than just the sum of its parts.
