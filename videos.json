This week, we will be taking a deeper look at how to extend core Titanium objects and create our own custom UI components.<br>In order to accomplish this, we will be using a technique popularized by JavaScript luminary Douglas Crockford, which is called parasitic inheritance. Parasitic inheritance takes advantage of the malleable nature of JavaScript objects, allowing a developer to create an instance of a given type, modify it with additional properties, and return it as a new type of object.<br>This is a very powerful technique in JavaScript applications generally, but is even more useful and powerful when dealing with JavaScript proxy objects in Titanium. We can use factory functions in the Ti.UI namespace to create base UI components, and then extend those components with new features and functionality we define ourselves.<br>Find out how use this technique to create a custom ratings widget in this week's episode of Forging Titanium.",

Throughout our reference guides and official training course, we generally advocate the use of a single JavaScript context in your Titanium applications.<br>However, in our most popular demo application, the Titanium Mobile Kitchen Sink, a tab-based application is developed using multiple contexts by associating each window opened with a URL to a JavaScript file. While this approach is technically valid, it presents the developer with difficulties around sharing data between windows, confusion around when code for a window has been executed, possible object reference issues which can lead to memory leaks, and reloading of JavaScript code in every window for shared libraries. For those reasons, unless you have a specific need for a \"clean slate\" in every window, using multiple JavaScript contexts cannot be considered a best practice approach to structuring a Titanium Mobile application.<br>What then would be a reasonable approach to structuring windows in a tabbed application? And how do we work around the loss of Ti.UI.currentTab and friends? Find out the answer in this week's episode of Forging Titanium.",

This module in particular will be a souped up version of the core `Titanium.Accelerometer` module. We will not only return accelerometer data, but also data regarding the magnetic field of the device so we can determine its physical orientation.<br>If that doesn't sound exciting enough for you, then perhaps you'll want to stick around for the sneak peek at Part 2 at the end.

I'm talking about the realtimeness of web development - changing files and being able to see results on the fly, both visually and regarding application logic. Compare it to Firebug's live CSS editing abilities and Chrome's live code changes. I'm also talking about bringing the beauty of web frameworks to Titanium - Stylus, SASS and Less for styling, CoffeeScript and its cousins to enhance development, Jasmine for testing, Backbone for MVC and jQuery and friends to simplify element creation, communication and handling. What if we could use all these techniques on top of Titanium to create native apps even faster and with better structure?<br>The solution is Kranium - the result of merging Titanium with web development techniques, creating a cyborg which is greater than just the sum of its parts. It will significantly speed up development and styling, and is useful both for prototyping and production apps. It will be release under the MIT license during the conference. The session is meant as an introduction of Kranium for all Titanium developers, but will be especially thrilling for those with a web development background.",
