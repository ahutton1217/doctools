    <p>    <span style="color: #000000;">
Flows are acyclic directed graphs of operational nodes which are composed of inputs, logic, and outputs. They are used by Endpoints, which require them for their runtime functionality of taking inputs and turning them into responses when an Endpoint is hit. Flows are written as <tt class=" ">.json</tt>    </span>
    <span style="color: #000000;">
 files and located within the    </span>
    <span style="color: #000000;">
 <tt class=" ">/flows</tt>    </span>
    <span style="color: #000000;">
 directory of your app.    </span>
<br>    <span style="color: #000000;">
Flows have a runtime context which can be written to and read from by individual nodes. This is how data is passed around in the flow. When running a flow via an endpoint, the data passed to the endpoint will propagate to the flow.    </span>
    </p>
    <p>    <span style="color: #000000;">
Beginning with API Builder Tools 3.0, flows can be created and configured using the API Orchestration flow editor. For additional information, see <a class="document-link unresolved" href="Flows.html#src-49158398">API Builder Flows</a>.<br>    </span>

        <h2 class="heading "><span>Flow context</span></h2>
    <p>    <span style="color: #000000;">
The <strong class=" ">Flow context</strong> is where data is temporarily stored at runtime while a Flow is being executed. This allows Flow Nodes to share information, by reading data from the context before execution using their parameters and writing data to the context after execution using <a class="document-link " href="JSONPath.html">JSONPath</a> selectors. If a flow is used by an endpoint which has certain parameters defined, these will also be accessible to Nodes from the flow context    </span>

        <h2 class="heading "><span>Flow input</span></h2>
    <p>    <span style="color: #000000;">
If a flow is executed from an endpoint, any parameters defined by the endpoint and correctly passed to the endpoint upon execution will be accessible from the flow context from the JSONPath selector:     </span>
<tt class=" ">$.params</tt><br>    <span style="color: #000000;">
For example, a header parameter called <tt class=" ">enabled</tt> would be accessible from     </span>
<tt class=" ">$.params.enabled.</tt>    <span style="color: #000000;">
 If a request is made with a parameter which is not defined in the endpoint&#x2019;s swagger, it will     </span>
    <span style="color: #000000;">
not     </span>
    <span style="color: #000000;">
be accessible from the flow.    </span>
