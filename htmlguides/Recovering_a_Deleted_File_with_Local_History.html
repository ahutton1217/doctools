    <p>Although you will usually use the Local History feature to compare versions of a file that you are editing, you can also use it as a last resort for recovering a deleted file, if you cannot find a copy of that file anywhere else on your system. You will have to have been working on the file using the <strong class=" ">Project Explorer</strong> View for this technique to work.    </p>
    <p>To recover a deleted file using Local History:    </p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>In the <strong class=" ">Project Explorer</strong> View, locate the project where the file used to be, then create an empty file with the same name and extension as the deleted file.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Right-click the empty file and select <strong class=" ">Replace With &gt; Previous from Local History</strong>.    </p>
</li></ol>    <p>The Local History feature will replace the content of the empty file with the content from the last version of the file in Studio.    </p>
