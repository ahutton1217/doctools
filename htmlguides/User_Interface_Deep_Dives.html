                        <h1>User Interface Deep Dives</h1>
    <p  >In the last chapter, you looked at the general ways to create the user interface of your app. In this chapter, we'll take a deeper look into the APIs you'll use to create various UI components. We'll look at tables and scrolling views, then move on to handling orientation, gestures, and animation. We'll finish out with some deeper looks at Android and iOS particulars.    </p>
    <div class="section section-2 " id="src-29004927_UserInterfaceDeepDives-Sections">
        <h2 class="heading "><span>Sections</span></h2>
    <p  ><strong class=" "><a  class="document-link " href="ListViews.html">List Views</a></strong>    </p>
    <p  >List Views are a very common mobile UI component. In this section, you'll explore the ListView-, ListSection- and ListItem-APIs to discover some of the more powerful and advanced features available through the Titanium API.    </p>
    <p  ><strong class=" "><a  class="document-link " href="Scrolling_Views.html">Scrolling Views</a></strong>    </p>
    <p  >Titanium offers two types of scrolling view containers: the ScrollView and the ScrollableView. We'll take a look at both in this section.    </p>
    <p  ><strong class=" "><a  class="document-link " href="Orientation.html">Orientation</a></strong>    </p>
    <p  >Is your UI locked in portrait mode? Not even sure how to lock it in place? In this section, we'll see how to specify UI orientations and how to handle orientation changes in your apps.    </p>
    <p  ><strong class=" "><a  class="document-link " href="Supporting_Gestures.html">Supporting Gestures</a></strong>    </p>
    <p  >&quot;Best of breed apps&quot; go beyond supporting simple taps and scrolls. In this section, we'll see how to support shakes, swipes, and other gestures.    </p>
    <p  ><strong class=" "><a  class="document-link " href="Animation.html">Animation</a></strong>    </p>
    <p  >Animation adds visual interest to an app, of course. But it can also improve the visual experience by alerting users to changing information or drawing attention to important aspects of an app. In this section, you'll learn how to create basic and matrix-based applications, and take advantage of iOS's built-in transitions.    </p>
    <p  ><strong class=" "><a  class="document-link " href="Custom_Fonts.html">Custom Fonts</a></strong>    </p>
    <p  >Custom fonts are a quick and easy way to personalize or brand your application. In this section, you'll learn how to add custom fonts to your iOS and Android apps.    </p>
    <p  ><strong class=" "><a  class="document-link " href="Accessibility.html">Accessibility</a></strong>    </p>
    <p  >Is your application accessible to persons with visual, hearing and motor handicaps? In this section, you'll learn how to use the accessibility features available through the Titanium API.    </p>
    <p  ><strong class=" "><a  class="document-link " href="Android_UI_Components_and_Conventions.html">Android UI Components and Conventions</a></strong>    </p>
    <p  >In this section, you'll examine some of the user interface and user experience components that are specific to Android.    </p>
    <p  ><strong class=" "><a  class="document-link " href="iOS_UI_Components_and_Conventions.html">iOS UI Components and Conventions</a></strong>    </p>
    <p  >This section examines some of the user interface and user experience components that are specific to iOS.    </p>
