                        <h1>Dashboard 4.0.0 Release Note</h1>
    <p>The Dashboard 4.0.0 release is a major release, introducing new features and behavior changes from previous releases.    </p>

<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>The top-level <strong class=" ">APIs</strong> menu, introduced in Release 2.3.0, was removed and most API applications can now be accessed from the top-level <strong class=" ">Apps</strong> menu. The <strong class=" ">Apps</strong> menu now lists all applications, which includes Titanium, native Android, native iOS, Arrow (formerly Node.ACS or Service APIs) and standalone ArrowDB (formerly ACS or Data APIs) applications. Note that only standalone ArrowDB applications not created with a client application will be displayed. For ArrowDB applications created with a client application, access the ArrowDB application from the client application&apos;s <strong class=" ">Arrow</strong> tab.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>The <i class=" ">All Apps</i> and <i class=" ">All APIs</i> pages have been merged into an <i class=" ">All Projects</i> page. To access the page, select <strong class=" ">All Projects</strong> from the <strong class=" ">Apps</strong> menu. The page lists the application name, type, supported platforms for client applications and the ability to favorite the application or delete the client application. Previously, the <i class=" ">All Apps</i> and <i class=" ">All APIs</i> pages would provide the creation date, operation status for API applications and ability to go to the <i class=" ">App Teams</i> page for client applications. Note that <strong class=" ">Data</strong> types are now called <strong class=" ">ArrowDB</strong> and <strong class=" ">Service</strong> types are called <strong class=" ">Arrow</strong>.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>In the <i class=" ">Application</i> page, the <strong class=" ">APIs</strong> tab was renamed to <strong class=" ">Arrow</strong> in the left navigation.    </p>
</li></ul>    </div>

        <h2 class="heading "><span>New Features</span></h2>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>To delete data from an ArrowDB application (formerly an ACS app or Data APIs), you will now be presented with a dialog that asks you to confirm the data deletion by entering the name of the application. The dialog appears after you click <strong class=" ">Delete</strong> from the ArrowDB application&apos;s <i class=" ">Manage Data</i> page.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>If a user is a member of only one organization, the <strong class=" ">Orgs</strong> menu will be hidden. If you are an organization admin and need access to the <i class=" ">Manage Organization</i> page, select <strong class=" ">Organization</strong> from the <strong class=" ">Profile</strong> menu.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Add <strong class=" ">Manage </strong> <strong class=" ">Billing</strong> to the <strong class=" ">Profile</strong> menu to go to the Billing Management site, where you can update your billing information or upgrade your Appcelerator Platform subscription.    </p>
